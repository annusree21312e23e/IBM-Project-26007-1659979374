## Features

- **[Automated Data Processing]** - This feature ensures that raw data is cleaned, preprocessed, and formatted before further analysis.
It includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering for better model performance.
Technologies used: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL for data storage.
- **[Machine Learning Model Implementation]** - The project includes an ML model for [specific task, e.g., sentiment analysis, fraud detection].
It involves training and testing using datasets, optimizing hyperparameters, and evaluating performance metrics.
Technologies used: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook.
- **[Web Application for User Interaction]** - A front-end interface allows users to interact with the model, upload data, or visualize results.
It includes real-time analytics, result interpretation, and API integration for a smooth experience.
Technologies used: Flask/Django (backend), React/HTML-CSS-JS (frontend), IBM Cloud/AWS for deployment.
